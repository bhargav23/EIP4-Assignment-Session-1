# Definitions

## Convolution
It is a linear operation on neural network. The CNN uses the convolution as dot product in the layers.  

## Filters/Kernels
It is a multidimensional array, which consist of parameters, used by  learning algorithms to extract the features of an image.
## Epochs
Training the model with entire training data once is called as epoch.

## 1x1 Convolution
The 1x1 convolution is used to extract the important features an reduces the dimensionality.

## 3x3 Convolution
The 3x3 convolution is a filter with channels, which is used to extract different features from the images such as edge direction.

## Feature Maps
A feature map is the output of a convolution function, which consists different features extracted by kernel.

## Activation Function
An Activation Function is used decide activate or deactivate the neurons in Neural networks. 

## Receptive Field
The region which is recived in feature map with the application of filters.
