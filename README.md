## Convolution

A convolution is a linear operation on neural network. The convolution neural network uses the convolution as dot product in the layers.  

## Filters/Kernels
A Kernel is a multidimetional array, which consist of parameters that are used by the learning algorithms to extrct the features of an image.

## Epochs
Training the model with entire training data once is called as epoch.

## 1x1 Convolution
The 1x1 convolution is used to extract the important features an reduces the dimensionality.

## 3x3 Convolution


## Feature Maps

## Activation Function
An Activation Function is used decide activate or deactivate the neurons in Neural networks. 

## Receptive Field
The region which is recived in feature map with the application of filters.
